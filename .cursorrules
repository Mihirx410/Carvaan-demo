# CARVAAN Project - Cursor AI Rules

## Project Overview
This is a travel website project called "CARVAAN" built with Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The project is located in the `Carvaan-demo/` folder.

## Critical Working Principles

### 1. UNDERSTAND BEFORE ACTING
- **NEVER** start working on any task without fully understanding the requirements
- If a prompt is unclear, ambiguous, or incomplete, ASK for clarification first
- Read and analyze relevant files before making changes
- Understand the project structure and file organization before editing
- Check existing code patterns and conventions before implementing new features

### 2. ERROR HANDLING MANDATE
- **ALWAYS** check for errors after making changes
- Run linter checks: `npm run lint` (if available)
- Check TypeScript compilation errors
- Verify imports and path aliases are correct
- If errors are found, fix them immediately before proceeding
- Never leave broken code in the project

### 3. NO UNAUTHORIZED CHANGES
- **ONLY** make changes that are explicitly requested
- Do NOT add features, optimizations, or "improvements" unless asked
- Do NOT refactor code unless specifically requested
- Do NOT change styling, formatting, or structure unless it's part of the task
- Do NOT add comments, documentation, or README files unless requested
- Preserve existing code patterns and conventions

### 4. FIGMA UI CLONING WORKFLOW
- **The user will provide Figma UI images** - These are the design references to clone exactly
- **The user will also provide UI images** - These show the current implementation to identify errors and differences
- **When working with Figma images**:
  1. Carefully examine the Figma design image provided
  2. Analyze colors, spacing, typography, layout, and component structure
  3. Compare with the current UI image to identify discrepancies
  4. Clone the Figma design EXACTLY as shown - match every detail
  5. Pay attention to:
     - Exact pixel spacing and margins
     - Color codes and gradients
     - Font sizes, weights, and line heights
     - Border radius and shadows
     - Image dimensions and aspect ratios
     - Responsive breakpoints
  6. Make the implementation match the Figma design precisely
- **When comparing with UI images**:
  1. Identify visual differences between current implementation and Figma design
  2. Note any layout issues, spacing problems, or styling mismatches
  3. Fix all discrepancies to match the Figma design exactly
  4. Ensure responsive behavior matches the design at all breakpoints

### 4.1. FIGMA_INSTRUCTIONS FILE USAGE
- **IMPORTANT**: The `FIGMA_INSTRUCTIONS` file contains detailed CSS and implementation instructions for specific sections
- **ONLY use this file when explicitly mentioned** - The user must explicitly state in their prompt to "follow the figma instruction file" or similar phrasing for a specific section
- **When the user requests to follow FIGMA_INSTRUCTIONS**:
  1. Read the `FIGMA_INSTRUCTIONS` file located in the project root
  2. Search for the specific section mentioned by the user (e.g., "hero section", "header", "footer", etc.)
  3. Extract the CSS properties, styling instructions, and any specific implementation details for that section
  4. Apply the CSS and instructions exactly as specified in the file
  5. Match the exact values, properties, and structure provided in the instructions
  6. If the section is not found in the file, inform the user and proceed with standard Figma image analysis
- **Do NOT reference this file unless explicitly requested** - Only check `FIGMA_INSTRUCTIONS` when the user's prompt specifically mentions it
- **Section matching**: Look for section names in the file that match or are similar to the section the user mentioned (e.g., "hero", "header", "footer", "logo", etc.)

### 5. STEP-BY-STEP WORKFLOW

#### Before Starting Any Task:
1. **Read the prompt carefully** - Understand exactly what is being asked
2. **Examine provided images** - If Figma or UI images are provided, analyze them thoroughly
3. **Identify the target location** - All work is in `Carvaan-demo/` folder
4. **Examine existing code** - Read relevant files to understand current patterns
5. **Check project structure** - Understand file organization and path aliases
6. **Verify dependencies** - Ensure required packages are available

#### During Implementation:
1. **Make minimal changes** - Only modify what's necessary to match the design
2. **Follow existing patterns** - Match code style and structure
3. **Use correct path aliases**:
   - `@/*` points to project root (Carvaan-demo/)
   - Images: `/logo.png`, `/hero.png`, etc. (direct in public/)
4. **Maintain component structure**:
   - All components in root `components/` folder
   - Layout components: `components/Header.tsx`, `components/Footer.tsx`
   - Section components: `components/Hero.tsx`, `components/HowItWorks.tsx`, etc.
   - UI components: `components/SearchBar.tsx`, `components/ScrollProvider.tsx`

#### After Making Changes:
1. **Check for errors** - Run linting and type checking
2. **Verify imports** - Ensure all imports are correct
3. **Test file paths** - Confirm image paths and asset references
4. **Compare with design** - Verify implementation matches Figma design (if provided)
5. **Review changes** - Ensure only requested changes were made

- Brand color: `#ae4a84` (used in Header and other components)

## Common Tasks & Guidelines

### Cloning from Figma Design:
1. **Analyze the Figma image** - Study colors, spacing, typography, layout
2. **Compare with current UI** - Identify differences using provided UI images
3. **Measure spacing** - Use exact pixel values from Figma
4. **Match colors exactly** - Use exact hex codes from Figma
5. **Replicate typography** - Match font family, size, weight, line height
6. **Match layout structure** - Replicate flexbox/grid layouts exactly
7. **Test responsiveness** - Ensure design matches at all breakpoints

### Adding a New Component:
1. Create component in `components/` folder
2. Follow existing component patterns (use 'use client' if needed)
3. Use TypeScript with proper types
4. Use Tailwind CSS for styling
5. Export as default export
6. Add to `app/page.tsx` if it's a section component

### Modifying Existing Components:
1. Read the component file first
2. Understand the current implementation
3. Compare with Figma design (if provided)
4. Make only the requested changes
5. Preserve existing functionality unless explicitly asked to change it
6. Match Figma design exactly for styling

### Fixing Errors:
1. Read the error message carefully
2. Identify the root cause
3. Check related files and imports
4. Fix the specific issue
5. Verify the fix resolves the error
6. Do not introduce new errors while fixing

## Important Reminders

- **Always ask for clarification** if the task is unclear
- **Never assume** - verify file paths, imports, and structure
- **Preserve existing code** - only change what's requested
- **Check for errors** after every change
- **Follow the project structure** - use correct folders and paths
- **Maintain consistency** - match existing code patterns and style
- **Match Figma designs exactly** - Pay attention to every detail when cloning designs
- **Compare with UI images** - Use provided UI images to identify and fix discrepancies

## When to Stop and Ask

Stop and ask for clarification if:
- The prompt is ambiguous or unclear
- Figma images are unclear or missing important details
- You cannot determine exact spacing, colors, or typography from the design
- The requested change conflicts with existing patterns
- You need to make assumptions about requirements
- The task requires decisions that weren't specified
- You encounter unexpected project structure or dependencies

**Remember**: Quality over speed. Understanding before action. Fix errors immediately. Make only requested changes. Clone Figma designs exactly as shown.
